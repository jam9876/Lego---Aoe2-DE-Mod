# Lego Aoe2:DE Mod
Crowdsourcing a re-skin of the Entirety of Age Of the Empires 2 in Legos in tiny stud sized steps

I have developed a pipeline get Lego models into Age of the Empires 2
Mecabricks.com / Blender / SLXstudio --> Aoe2

How can I contribute? Do I need skills?

No; you don't need any special skills, just a nack and a passion for contructing fancy lego-buildings.
Mecabricks.com is a free Lego-Builder, it is very easy to use, no download required.  Create an account and start building.

Buildings need to be scaled correctly, (this is very easy) Lego Studs to Age Tiles -- 9x9 studs to 1 Age tiles.  a [ 9:1 ] Ratio
(for example, a mining camp is 2x2 age tiles --> so in mecabricks you would create a 18x18 stud platform.) 


Have experience in Blender? particularly with shaders and texture manipulation?
We need you, 'I' need you lol,
